# Instrumentation Authors Guide

This guide is for authors of OpenTelemetry Ruby instrumentation libraries. It provides guidance on how to contribute an instrumentation library.

Please make sure to read and understand the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide before submitting any changes to instrumentation.

## What we expect from you

We are a community of volunteers with a shared goal of improving observability in Ruby applications.

We welcome contributions from everyone, and we want to make sure that you have a great experience contributing to this project, as well as a positive impact on the Ruby community.

We have limited capacity to maintain instrumentation libraries, so we ask that you commit to maintaining the instrumentation library you contribute.

In addition to the requirements to maintain at least community member status, contributing an instrumentation to this project requires the following:

1. Responding to issues and pull requests
2. Performing timely code reviews and responding to issues
3. Addressing security vulnerabilities
4. Keeping the instrumentation library up to date with the latest:
    * OpenTelemetry Ruby API and SDK changes
    * Ruby language changes
    * Instrumented library changes

If you do not have the capacity to maintain the instrumentation library, please consider contributing to the OpenTelemetry Ruby project in other ways, or consider creating a separate project for the instrumentation library.

> :warning: Libraries that do not meet these requirements may be removed from the project at any time at the discretion of OpenTelemetry Ruby Contrib Maintainers.

## Contributing a New Instrumentation Library

Our long-term goal is to provide instrumentation for all popular Ruby libraries. Ideally we would like to have first-party instrumentation for all libraries maintained by the Gem authors to ensure compatability with upstream gems, however in many cases this is not possible.

For this reason we welcome contributions of new instrumentation libraries that cannot be maintained by the original gem authors as first party instrumentations.

The following steps are required to contribute a new instrumentation library:

1. Generate an instrumentation gem skeleton
2. Implement the instrumentation library including comprehensive automated tests
3. Add the instrumentation library to the appropriate CI workflow
4. Include documentation for your instrumentation
    * Document all instrumentation-specific configuration options in the `README.md` and `yardoc` comments
    * Document all semantic conventions used by the instrumentation in the `README.md`
    * Provide executable examples in an `examples` directory
5. Submit a pull request

## Generate the Gem

This repository contains a script to generate a new instrumentation library.

The snippet below demonstrates how to generate a an instrumentation for the `werewolf` gem, starting from the repository root.

```console

$bash opentelemetry-ruby-contrib> bin/instrumentation_generator werewolf

```

The output of the generator shows that it creates a new directory in the `instrumentation` directory using the name of the gem:

``` console

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

 WARNING: Your gem will *NOT* be tested until you add it to the CI workflows in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`!!

## Implementation guidelines

The original design and implementation of this project was heavily influenced by Datadog's `dd-trace-rb` project. You may refer to the [Datadog Porting Guide](datadog-porting-guide.md) as a reference for implementing instrumentations, however the following guidelines are specific to OpenTelemetry Ruby:

*. Use `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Base`
*. Use the OpenTelemetry API
*. Use First Party Extension Points
*. Use Semantic Conventions
*. Write comprehensive automated tests
*. Understand Performance Characteristics

### Use `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Base`

The entry point of your instrumentation should be implemented as a subclass of `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Base`:

* Implement `install` block, where all of the integration work happens
* Implement `present` block
* Implement `compatible` block and check for at least the minumum required gem version

### Use the OpenTelemetry API

Instrumentations are intended to be portable and usable with vendor distributions of the SDK. For this reason, you must use the OpenTelemetry API to create spans and add attributes, events, and links to spans and avoid using the OpenTelemetry SDK directly.

Each instrumentation _must_ use a named tracer. Instrumentations that inherit from `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Base` will get a single helper method that will automatically provide your instrumentation with a named tracer under `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::${Gem Name>}::Instrumentation.instance.tracer`.

For example, the `Werewolf` generated in the example above instrumentation is available `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Werewolf::Instrumentation.instance.tracer`. You should reference this tracer in your code when creating spans like this:

```ruby

  OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Werewolf::Instrumentation.instance.tracer.start_span('transform') do
    # code to be traced
  end

```

> :warning: This tracer is not _upgradable_ before the SDK is initialized, therefore it is important that your instrumentation _always_ use stack local references of the tracer.

### Use First Party Extension Points

Whenever possible, use first party extension points (hooks) to instrument libraries. This ensures that the instrumentation is compatible with the latest versions of the library and that the instrumentation is maintained by the library authors. `ActiveSupport::Notifications` and `Middleware` are good examples of a first party extension points that are used by our instrumentation libraries.

Monkey patching is discouraged in OpenTelemetry Ruby because it is the most common source of bugs and incompatability with the libraries we are instrumenting. If you must monkey patch, please ensure that the monkey patch is as isolated as possible and that it is clearly documented.

### Use Semantic Conventions

Use the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions to ensure that the instrumentation is compatible with other OpenTelemetry libraries and that the data is useful in a distributed context.

> :information_source: Privacy and security are important considerations when adding attributes to spans. Please ensure that you are not adding sensitive information to spans. If you are unsure, please ask for a review.

When semantic conventions do not exist, use the [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) and submit a Issue/PR with your attributes to the [Semantic Conventions repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions) to propose a new set of standard attributes.

If the attribute is specific to your instrumentation, then consider namespacing it using the `instrumentation` prefix e.g. `werewolf.bite.damage`.

### Write Comprehensive Automated Tests

Code that is not tested will not be accepted by maintainers. We understand that providing 100% test coverage is not always possible but we still ask that you provide your best effort when writing automated tests.

Most of the libraries we are instrumenting introduce changes that are outside of our control. For this reason integration or state based tests are preferred over interaction (mock) tests.

When you do in fact run into cases where test doubles or API stubs are absolutely necessary then we recommend using the `rspec-mocks` and `webmocks` gems.

### Understand Performance Characteristics

Instrumentation libraries should be as lightweight as possible

* Avoid allocating too many objects and private methods
* Rely on `rubocop-performance` linters to catch performance issues
* Consider using [microbenchmarks](https://github.com/evanphx/benchmark-ips) and [profiling](https://ruby-prof.github.io/) to address any possible performance issues

## Enable CI

This project contains multiple CI workflows that execute tests and ensures the gems are installable.

### Standalone Instrumentations

For standalone instrumentations that do not have any external service dependencies, add the gem to the `/.github/workflows/ci-instrumentation.yml` file under `jobs/instrumentation/strategy/matrix/gem`:

``` yaml

jobs:
  instrumentation:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        gem:
          - action_pack
          - action_view
          - active_job
          # ...
          - werewolf
        os:
          - ubuntu-latest

```

#### JRuby Compatibility

If your gem is incompatible with `JRuby`you can exclude them from the matrix by adding an entry to the `/.github/workflows/ci-instrumentation.yml` file under `jobs/instrumentation/steps/[name="JRuby Filter"]`:

``` yaml
      - name: "JRuby Filter"
        id: jruby_skip
        shell: bash
        run: |
          echo "skip=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          [[ "${{ matrix.gem }}" == "action_pack"              ]] && echo "skip=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          # ...
          [[ "${{ matrix.gem }}" == "werewolf"                     ]] && echo "skip=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          # This is essentially a bash script getting evaluated, so we need to return true or the whole job fails.
          true
```

### External Service Instrumentations

Adding jobs for instrumentations that have external service dependencies may be a bit more difficult if the job does not already have a similar service configured.

#### Using Existing Services

CI is currently configured to support the following services:

* kafka
* memcached
* mongodb
* mysql
* postgresql
* rabbitmq
* redis

If your gem depends on one of those services then great! The next step is to at the gem to matrix in the `/.github/workflows/ci-service-instrumentation.yml` file under `jobs/instrumentation_*/strategy/matrix/gem`:

```yaml

  instrumentation_kafka:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        gem:
          - racecar
          - rdkafka
          - ruby_kafka
          - werewolf
        os:
          - ubuntu-latest
```

#### Adding a New Service

Assuming your external service is not supported, you may consider adding it as a new job in the `/.github/workflows/ci-service-instrumentation.yml` file, however we will accept new services on a case-by-case basis.

Add the service container to `jobs/instrumentation_with_services/services` and add the gem to the matrix in `jobs/instrumentation_with_services/strategy/matrix/gem`:

```yaml

  instrumentation_with_services:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        gem:
          - dalli
          - mongo
          - werewolf
        os:
          - ubuntu-latest
    services:
      # ...
      my_service:
        image: my_service:latest
        # ...
```

> :information_source: Please refer to the official [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services/about-service-containers) for more information on how to add a service container.

If we determine the service container slows down the test suite significantly, it may make sense to copy the marix and steps stanzas from an existing instrumentation and update it to use the new service container as a dependency:

```yaml

  instrumentation_silver:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        gem:
          - werewolf
        os:
          - ubuntu-latest
    name: other / ${{ matrix.gem }} / ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: "Test Ruby 3.3"
        uses: ./.github/actions/test_gem
        with:
          gem: "opentelemetry-instrumentation-${{ matrix.gem }}"
          ruby: "3.3"
      - name: "Test Ruby 3.2"
        uses: ./.github/actions/test_gem
        with:
          gem: "opentelemetry-instrumentation-${{ matrix.gem }}"
          ruby: "3.2"
      - name: "Test Ruby 3.1"
        uses: ./.github/actions/test_gem
        with:
          gem:  "opentelemetry-instrumentation-${{ matrix.gem }}"
          ruby: "3.1"
      - name: "Test Ruby 3.0"
        uses: ./.github/actions/test_gem
        with:
          gem:  "opentelemetry-instrumentation-${{ matrix.gem }}"
          ruby: "3.0"
          yard: true
          rubocop: true
          build: true
      - name: "Test JRuby"
        uses: ./.github/actions/test_gem
        with:
          gem:  "opentelemetry-instrumentation-${{ matrix.gem }}"
          ruby: "jruby-9.4.2.0"
    services:
      # ...
      my_service:
        image: my_service:latest
        # ...
```

## Documentation

### README and Yardoc

The `instrumentation_generator` will create a `README.md` file for your instrumentation. Please ensure that the `README` is up-to-date and contains the following:

1. The span names, events, and semantic attributes that are emitted by the instrumentation
2. The configuration options that are available
3. Any known limitations or caveats
4. The minimum supported gem version

In addition to that There should also be redundant `yardoc` comments in the entrypoint of your gem, i.e. the subclass `OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Base`.

> :information_source: See the `ActiveJob` instrumentation [`README`](./active_job/README.md) for a comprehensive example.

### Examples

Executuable examples should be included in the `examples` directory that demonstrate how to use the instrumentation in a real-world scenario.

We recommend using Bundler's inline gemfile to run the examples. Here is an example from the `grape` instrumentation:

```ruby

# frozen_string_literal: true

require 'bundler/inline'

gemfile(true) do
  source 'https://rubygems.org'
  gem 'grape', '~> 1.2'
  gem 'opentelemetry-sdk'
  gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-rack'
  gem 'opentelemetry-instrumentation-grape'
end

# Export traces to console
ENV['OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER'] ||= 'console'

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.service_name = 'trace_demonstration'
  c.use_all # this will only require instrumentation gems it finds that are installed by bundler.
end

at_exit do
  OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider.shutdown
end

# A basic Grape API example
class ExampleAPI < Grape::API
  format :json

  desc 'Return a greeting message'
  get :hello do
    { message: 'Hello, world!' }
  end

  desc 'Return information about a user'
  params do
    requires :id, type: Integer, desc: 'User ID'
  end
  get 'users/:id' do
    { id: params[:id], name: 'John Doe', email: 'johndoe@example.com' }
  end
end

# Set up fake Rack application
builder = Rack::Builder.app do
  # Integration is automatic in web frameworks but plain Rack applications require this line.
  # Enable it in your config.ru.
  use *OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rack::Instrumentation.instance.middleware_args
  run ExampleAPI
end
app = Rack::MockRequest.new(builder)

app.get('/hello')
app.get('/users/1')

```
